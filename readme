3.find the way to filter the information we need from twitter,should we find the information by user or keywords.
4.apply for twitter api and google api,because it may take some time to get authorized.
5.learn google api first so we can know what google api need in order to analyze sentiment and i will try to learn how to access 
these data by twitter api.
6.learn how to get neccessary information by twitter api. compare the result of different ways because there are many ways we can 
get tweets. stream() isn't neccesary because i don't need to analyze the latest tweets. user_timeline is also unneccesary because 
i want to get tweets by keywords so i choose the api.search() to get what i need.
7.start programming tweepy.
8.concentrate on google natural language api,learn how its result correspond to different sentiment because the program only return
some numbers.
